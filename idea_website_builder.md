# Tamil AI Website Builder - Concept & Architecture

## Core Concept
A "No-Code" Website Builder specifically optimized for the Tamil market, allowing users to generate high-end, premium web applications in minutes using simple text prompts.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- **Speed:** "1 Hour Website" vs weeks of development.
- **Aesthetics:** High-end, glassmorphic, "World AI Summit" style designs by default (solving the "Wordpress is ugly" problem).
- **Language:** Native Tamil language support (AI-generated copy, headers, and UI).
- **Architecture:** Generates a full Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind stack, not just a static page.

## Detailed Features

### 1. The Builder Interface (The "Vibe" Creator)
- **Prompt-Based Input:** User types "Gold Jewelry Shop in Chennai, Premium feel".
- **Vibe Sliders:** Control style (Classic vs Cyberpunk), Color Temp, and Animation intensity.
- **Language Toggle:** One-click switch to generate the entire site content in Tamil.

### 2. The Output (The "Product")
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Supabase.
- **Included Modules:**
  - Automated Admin Dashboard (Content Management).
  - Dynamic Sections (Hero, Gallery, Bento Grids).
  - Pre-configured Database Tables.
  - SEO & AEO Optimization built-in.

### 3. The Deployment Engine
- One-click deployment to Vercel/Netlify.
- Auto-provisioning of Supabase project.

## Technical Roadmap (Draft)

### Phase 1: The "Prototype Generator"
- Create a script that takes a JSON configuration (Color, Title, Language) and utilizes the existing "World AI Summit" codebase as a template.
- Implement a basic AI script to translate English prompts into a Tailwind theme configuration and Tamil text content.

### Phase 2: The Builder UI
- Build the "Command Center" dashboard (Glassmorphic, Split-screen).
- specific prompt-to-database schema generator.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor "World AI Robotics Summit" code into a reusable "Master Template".
- [ ] Experiment with an AI script to generate Tamil copy for specific industries.
